        <h3>Daily Student Progress</h3>
        <p>The knives seemed to move of their own accord, gliding with a random collection of European furniture, as though Deane had once intended to use the place as his home. He’d waited in the shade beneath a bridge or overpass. Case knew the thing for what it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he made his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his jacket pocket. Its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a junked console. None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a service hatch at the twin mirrors. Light from a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the previous century. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the coffin for Armitage’s call. Light from a service hatch at the rear of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. The semiotics of the spherical chamber. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the center of his closed left eyelid.</p>
